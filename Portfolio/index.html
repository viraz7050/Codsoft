        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>a 22-year-old boy, I would describe myself as a curious and creative individual. I have a passion for learning and exploring new things, especially in the fields of 
            web development. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, and playing vollyball. I am also a keen reader and enjoy getting lost in the pages of a good book. I am a friendly and empathetic person, and I enjoy helping others and making new friends. At school, I am a hard-working student and take pride in my academic achievements. I have aspirations of one day pursuing a career in the technical and making a positive impact on the world.</p>

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>Tesla Coil
                Wireless power
                transfer using Tesla
                Coil (mini project)</p>

                <p><br>The Tesla coil works on a principle to achieve a condition called resonance. Here, the primary coil emits huge amounts of current into the secondary coil to drive the secondary circuit with maximum energy. The fine-tuned circuit helps to shoot the current from primary to secondary circuit at a tuned resonant frequency.

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Advanced footstep
                power generator
                using piezoelectric
                sensors and RFID
                for
                battery charging
                (Final year project)</p>
                <p><br>In this system, power is utilized with the help of human footsteps and piezoelectric sensors. The waste power is stored in the battery, which is used for charging purpose when users need. By using RFID technology, assigning of user is done with the help of identification card.
